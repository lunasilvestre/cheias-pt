# cheias.pt

Flood monitoring platform for Portugal. Portfolio project targeting Development Seed.

## Current Phase: 0 — Discovery

We are researching, not building. **Do not write application code.**

Read `DISCOVERY-PROMPT.md` for the full brief. It contains 6 research tasks designed for an agents team.

## Critical: Existing Intelligence

Extensive prior research exists in the Obsidian vault. **Read before researching:**

## Key Context

- Portugal only at this stage. Domain cheias.pt is owned.
- Existing STAC/COG viewer prototype at `~/Documents/dev/geo-viz-deliverable/`
- Custom STAC/COG skill at `/mnt/skills/user/stac-cog-viewer/`
- n8n running at n8n.lunasilvestre.systems
