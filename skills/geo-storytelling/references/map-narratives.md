# Map Narratives & Scrollytelling

**[STUB]** This reference file would contain patterns for building storytelling experiences and temporal playback.

**Topics to cover:**
- Scrollytelling chapter configurations (camera positions, layer opacity changes, scroll triggers)
- MapLibre camera transitions (flyTo, easeTo, duration, easing functions)
- Timeline controls for temporal data (playback, scrubber, speed management)
- Narrative structure: What → Why → What You Can Do
- Synchronized map + text panels for guided exploration

**Source material:** Vizzuality's layers-storytelling framework, Half-Earth scrolling experiences, Soils Revealed narrative structure.

**Status:** Research completed but detailed patterns not yet documented. Agents extracted code examples during Vizzuality repo analysis but did not synthesize into this reference file.
