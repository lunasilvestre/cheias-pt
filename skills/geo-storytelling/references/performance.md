# Performance & Rendering Patterns

**[STUB]** This reference file would contain patterns for rendering large datasets and temporal animations.

**Topics to cover:**
- WebGL sprite pooling (pre-allocating resources to prevent garbage collection)
- Binary tile formats (Protobuf, vector tiles)
- Temporal indexing (organizing data by time buckets for efficient playback)
- 4wings architecture (GlobalFishingWatch's production-grade spatiotemporal tiling system)
- MapLibre custom layers and deck.gl integration

**Source material:** Research documented in `/home/nls/Documents/dev/cheias-pt/research/03-performance-rendering.md` (comprehensive technical documentation of GlobalFishingWatch rendering patterns).

**Status:** Research completed and documented separately. Should be integrated into this reference file if performance becomes critical for cheias.pt implementation.
