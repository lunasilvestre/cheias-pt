# Trust & Transparency Patterns

**[STUB]** This reference file would contain patterns for communicating data sources, uncertainty, and warnings.

**Topics to cover:**
- Institutional attribution patterns (leading with recognizable authorities like IPMA, Copernicus)
- Data freshness indicators (green/yellow/red dots, "Updated 2h ago" badges)
- Confidence levels and uncertainty visualization (P10-P90 ranges, scenario bounds)
- Warning severity design (IPMA awareness levels: green/yellow/orange/red)
- User Stories pattern (pre-built views for different personas: farmer, municipal planner, researcher)
- Methodology page structure (plain language → visual diagram → technical details → limitations)

**Source material:** CoCliCo's scenario-based flood risk communication, Resource Watch's institutional trust signals, Global Forest Watch's multi-source alert confidence system.

**Status:** Principles established in SKILL.md Core Principles #2 and #4, but detailed implementation patterns not yet documented.
